/*Bill Splitter app:
 This app lets you input a bill amount for rent, utilities, etc. and then the number of people to split between which can have different percentages applied to it and the app will return what each person should pay.
 There also is another area for splitting a restaurant bill which includes a tip calculator so you can input the tip percentage you want to give and that will be applied to the split amounts.*/
